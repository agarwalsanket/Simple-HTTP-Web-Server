# Simple-HTTP-Web-Server
The aim of Project 1: (Simple Web Server) was to develop a simple Web server that is capable of processing requests from client (browser).
For the completion of this project I have used Java programming language.
I have also used HTML and JavaScript for building a file which could be displayed in the browser.

Running the server:
1. First run the server, i.e., the Java Class (Web- ServerHTTP.java ).
2. Then go to any browser on the same system where you have run the Java class.
3. Type http://localhost:8080/CN in the browser.
4. You would see a simple web page which was retrieved from the local web server.
5. In the text box enter the file name as text (which is the file stored in the server, 
itâ€™s the Computer Networks text book), the pdf file will open in another window.
